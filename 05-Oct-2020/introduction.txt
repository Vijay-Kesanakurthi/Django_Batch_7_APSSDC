oop:
- program is divided into objects
- makes use of Acsess Modiffiers - public,private,protected
- it is more secure
- it support inheritances

pop:

- Doesn't use Acsess Modiffiers
- it is less secure
- not support inheritances

Inheritance:
    Acquiring properties of one class to another class
    - syntax :
        class subClassName(Parentclass1[,parentclass2,.....]):
            functions

        class_suite
